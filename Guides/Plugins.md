### Plugins

To use Meow plugins, place a `MeowPlugins` file at the root of your Swift package. This file contains a list of plugin names (the same as the Swift package they come in), separated by newlines. Plugins provide a `MeowPlugin.ejs` template file in the root directory of their package.

We don't have any documentation on writing plugins yet.
