# üêà Meow

Meow is a **boilerplate-free** object persistence framework for Swift and MongoDB, from the creators of [MongoKitten](https://github.com/openkitten/mongokitten). 

It manages your database for you, so you can focus on writing your application.

## How to read the documentation

This documentation contains references for all functions and types within Meow, along with additional guides and architectural information.

To learn the basics, start by reading the [Getting Started](getting-started.html) guide and the [Meow CLI](cli.html) guide.

When you want to dive more in depth, you can read about [Migrations](migrations.html) and [Plugins](plugins.html).

To learn more about the inner working of Meow, we have documents describing the [Data Format](data-format.html) and [Saving Strategy and Object Pooling mechanism](saving-strategy-and-object-pooling.html).
